### Structure
* I've taken the liberty of setting up a basic structure to help keep us organized. If this turns out to be far off base from what our instructors are going to suggest tonight (11/10) I'll go ahead and make some changes
  * resources
    * I hope to store all of our data here. I've made sub folders for raw and cleaned data.
  * notebooks
    * I've gone ahead and made a starter notebook for everyone to work on. If we all make sure to commit and push/pull regularly we should be able to keep up to date on what people are working on.
